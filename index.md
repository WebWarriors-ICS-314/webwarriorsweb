## Overview

[NoteHub-Mﾄ］oa](https://github.com/web-warriors-hub/web-warriors-hub.github.io) is a collaborative platform created by and for UH Mﾄ］oa students to share, search, and rate lecture notes. It addresses the common stress students face when preparing for exams without reliable study materials. What makes it unique:

- Every student can upload their own notes
- Filtering by **course**, **professor**, and **semester**
- Ability to access notes from previous semesters

NoteHub-Mﾄ］oa is more than a file-sharing app窶琶t's a student-built ecosystem for academic support.
